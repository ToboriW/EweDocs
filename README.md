# Ewe Documentation
Ewe is a JVM implementation that runs on Windows CE and other low-resource devices. It also runs on desktop computers. 

While its documentation for most common tasks is more than adequate, as soon as you start wanting to make your own custom widgets, it can become quite esoteric. Sometimes you are forced to comb through the source code to find the behaviour of whatever it is you are implementing.

This repository is meant to be a supplement to Ewe's documentation. Basically, if it takes me awhile to figure something out, there will probably be a tutorial here (or some kind of explanation).
